# Rolling Dice
> **This is a simple rolling dice app, built with the intention of applying and learning things like basic Animation, splash screen, app icon etc. in Flutter UI development.**<p></p>
> **Flutter made Apps are cross-platform, and uses *Dart Language* as the base language.** 

## Features
